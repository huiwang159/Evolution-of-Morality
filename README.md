# evo_gam_mor
evo_gam_mor presents two simulations that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. 

Each invidual has the following attributes: morality, probability of interacting morally; naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals; and memory, probability of interacting with the individual with highest value.



|         | Moral | Immoral |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |


All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation.
