# Evolutionary Game Theory Model of Human Morality
Two simulations that may explain the origin of human morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory.
The payoff matrix is as follows.

|         | Moral | Immoral |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |

All simulations converge towards moral behaviour before the 100th generation.
