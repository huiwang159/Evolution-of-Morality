# evo_gam_mor
This is a simulation that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. 

Given the following payoff matrix for each interaction, individuals gain fitness through a fixed number of interaction throughout their life times. Each invidual has the following inheritable attributes: morality, probability of interacting morally; naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals; and memory, probability of interacting with the individual with highest value. All simulation converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation. This shows that a good memory is a prerequisite for the arising of morality; otherwise repeated interactions would not occur; or prosocial behaviour is a consequence of intelligence. I am no expert, of course.

|         | Moral | Immoral |

| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |
