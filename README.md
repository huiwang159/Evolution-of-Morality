# evo_gam_mor
evo_all is a simulation that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. Given the following payoff matrix for each interaction, individuals interact with each other a fixed number of times. Each invidual has the following inheritable attributes: morality, probability of interacting morally; naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals; and memory, probability of interacting with the individual with highest value. Individuals reproduce proportionally to their fitness accumulated over their interactions.

All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation, despite the fact that interacting immorally is the dominant strategy of each single stage. In this model, as in life, acting immorally is penny wise, pound foolish.



In this model, the benefit of interacting morally is offset by the decreased number of interactions by others, which is a function of memory. This confirms that it is better to be a good person

All simulation converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation. This shows that a good memory is a prerequisite for the arising of morality; otherwise repeated interactions would not occur; or prosocial behaviour is a consequence of intelligence. I am no expert, of course.
