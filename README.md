# Evolutionary Game Theory Model of Morality
- Two simulations that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. 
- The payoff matrix is as follows.

|         | Moral | Immoral |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |

Each ind
The morality variable is probability of interacting morally. naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals

All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation.
