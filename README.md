# evo_gam_mor
Two simulations that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. 

Each invidual has the following attributes:
- morality, probability of interacting morally
  - the payoff matrix of each interaction is presented below
- naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals
- memory, probability of interacting with the individual with highest value

|         | Moral | Immoral |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |


All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation.
