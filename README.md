# evo_gam_mor
evo_all is a simulation that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. Given the following payoff matrix for each interaction, individuals interact with each other a fixed number of times. Each invidual has the following inheritable attributes: morality, probability of interacting morally; naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals; and memory, probability of interacting with the individual with the highest value. Individuals reproduce proportionally to their fitness accumulated over their interactions.

All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation, despite the fact that interacting immorally is the dominant strategy of each single interaction. In this model, as in life, immorality at the expense of future cooperation is penny wise, pound foolish. This may also show that long-term memory, without which repeated cooperation with favourable track records would not occur, is a pre-requisite for the arising of morality. 

I am no expert in evolutionary psychology, of course.
