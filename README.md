# Evolutionary Game Theory Model of Morality
Two simulations that may explain the origin of morality within the framework of evolutionary game theory. The payoff matrix is as follows.

|         | Moral | Immoral |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Moral   | 2,2   | 0,3     |
| Immoral | 3,0   | 1,1     |

Each individual has the following variables:
- morality, probability of interacting morally
- naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals
- memory, probability of interacting with the individual with highest value


The morality variable is probability of interacting morally. naivety, assumed utility of interactions with all individuals

All simulations converge towards moral behaviour by the 100th generation.
